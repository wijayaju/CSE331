# Non-Constructible Change Problem

## Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers representing coin denominations, determine the smallest amount of money (change) that you cannot create using any combination of the coins you have. The goal is to identify the minimal value that cannot be formed with any subset of the coins.

## What You Need to Solve

Your task is to write a function that takes an array of integers as input, where each integer represents a coin denomination, and returns the smallest amount of money that cannot be constructed with those coins.

## Example

### Input

```plaintext
coins = [1, 2, 5, 10]
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
4
```

# Explanation of Non-Constructible Change

Given a set of coin denominations, we need to determine the smallest amount of money (change) that cannot be created using any combination of these coins. Let's analyze the process using an example where the coins are `[1, 2, 5, 10]`.

## Step-by-Step Process to Determine Non-Constructible Change:

### 1. Individual Coin Analysis:
- **Coin `1`**: With just this coin, the only sum we can create is `1`.

### 2. Adding Another Coin:
- **Coins `1` and `2`**:
  - With these coins, we can create the following sums:
    - `1` (using the first `1` coin alone),
    - `2` (using the `2` coin alone),
    - `3` (by combining `1` and `2`).

### 3. Including More Coins:
- **Coins `1, 2,` and `5`**:
  - Adding the `5` coin expands our possibilities. Now we can create:
    - All previous sums (`1, 2, 3`),
    - `5` (using the `5` coin alone),
    - `6` (combining `1` and `5`),
    - `7` (combining `2` and `5`),
    - `8` (combining `1, 2,` and `5`).
  - Notice that we still cannot create the sum of `4` with any combination of these coins.

### 4. Adding the Largest Coin:
- **Coins `1, 2, 5,` and `10`**:
  - The addition of the `10` coin allows us to create even larger sums. Combining it with smaller coins, we can create sums well beyond `10` (like `11`, `12`, `13`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `20`, and so on).
  - However, despite these combinations, the sum of `4` remains elusive. We can't combine `1, 2,` and `5` in any way to make exactly `4`.

## Conclusion:
Given the coins `[1, 2, 5, 10]`, we can create many sums, but not `4`. Therefore, `4` is the smallest non-constructible change. This means if someone needed `4` cents, we couldn't provide it using any combination of these coins.

## Guidelines

1. **Sort and Scan**: One way to solve this problem is to sort the array and then scan through it to find the first gap in constructible change.
2. **Think Efficiently**: While sorting can help simplify the problem, consider how you might solve the problem if sorting was not feasible or if you had constraints on the coin values.

Implement this in a function and provide the correct output for the given input array. Your solution should handle any array of positive integers.
