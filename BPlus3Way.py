class BPlusTreeNode:
    """
    B+ Tree implementation with insertion, search, and in-order traversal.

    üìå Disclaimer on Balancing and Deletion:

    This implementation is intentionally simplified for educational purposes.

    - ‚úÖ No balancing after insertion:
        B+ trees naturally stay balanced through node splitting.
        When a node becomes full, it is split and the middle key is pushed up.
        This ensures the tree remains balanced without additional logic,
        maintaining logarithmic height and efficient operations.

    - ‚ùå No deletion:
        Deletion is not implemented in this version.
        In practice, B+ tree deletions are rare in most applications such as databases,
        file systems, and indexing structures. Deletions are often handled by:
            - Logical deletion (marking entries as deleted),
            - Lazy deletion (cleanup at a later time),
            - Or batch reorganization.
        This approach avoids the complexity and cost of constant rebalancing.

    - ‚öôÔ∏è Typical Runtime Behavior:
        - All core operations (insert, search, traversal) run in O(log n) time.
        - In real-world systems, the dominant cost is I/O time (disk access),
          not the in-memory tree manipulation.
        - Therefore, simplified insertions with rare splits reflect actual runtime usage well.

    This class is ideal for demonstrating the structure and behavior of B+ trees
    without the added complexity of rebalancing or deletion logic.
