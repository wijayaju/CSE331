🪙 Number of Ways to Make Change

Given an array of distinct positive integers representing coin denominations and a non-negative integer n representing a target amount of money, write a function that returns the number of ways to make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.

🧠 Note: You have an unlimited number of coins for each denomination.

🔢 Sample Input

n = 6  
denoms = [1, 5]

🎯 Sample Output

2  # (6x1), (1x1 + 1x5)




📈 Optimal Space & Time Complexity
	•	Time Complexity: O(n * d)
	•	Space Complexity: O(n)
Where:
	•	n is the target amount
	•	d is the number of coin denominations
