### Complete the following exercise as a Practice Run in Python.
 This is an excellent opportunity to get familiar with Codio

**Pairwise Sum:**
Write a function that receives a non-empty collection of unique integers alongside another integer, which stands for a target sum.

- If two numbers from the given list combine to achieve the target sum, the function ought to provide them within a list, regardless of order.

- If not a single pair from the list yields the target sum, the function is to produce an empty list.

Bear in mind, the desired sum should be the result of combining two distinct numbers from the list; using the same number twice to hit the target is off-limits.

It's safe to assume there will be, at most, a single pair of numbers that meets the sum criteria.
